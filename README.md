### About

This is a NBA Stats React app that will allow you to select and view NBA games from the 2019 season. Games are sorted by team, and can be further viewed to see player data of that game.


### Assuming the API was slow, what are some optimizations that could be implemented to improve the user experience?

* Implement a loading status that will let the user know that the component is being loaded
* Cache data so when someone reloads the site, they will have stored data

### Any improvements you would make to your application?

* Better error tracking by implementing Sentry
* Ensure quality of data by validating data types upon receiving API responses
* Better data analytics that includes charting and custom metrics
* Compare individual player stats with the player stats of selected game
* Build out more features that will include hypothetical player trading and custom analytics on how those trades would impact the 2019 season
* Implement better CSS
